# DS100: Principle and Technology of Data Science (Summer 2019)

> **Description**

Combining data, computation, and inferential thinking, data science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and understand their world. 

This intermediate level class bridges between Data8 and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields. In this class, we explore key areas of data science including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making. 

Through a strong emphasis on data centric computing, quantitative critical thinking, and exploratory data analysis, this class covers key principles and techniques of data science. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing.

> **Prerequisites**

- Foundations of Data Science: basic exposure to python programming and working with tabular data as well as visualization, statistics, and machine learning

- Computing: additional background in python programming (e.g., for loops, lambdas, debugging, and complexity) that will enable DS100 to focus more on the concepts in Data Science and less on the details of programming in python

- Math: linear operators, eigenvectors, derivatives, and integrals to enable statistical inference and derive new prediction algorithms
